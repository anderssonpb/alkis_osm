Automation of the Analysis of Differences between ALKIS and OSM Data with Geopandas

This project involves comparing geospatial data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the Real Estate Cadastre System (ALKIS) for buildings (Geb√§ude) in the city of Bielefeld. The structure of the analysis was inspired by Florian Lohoff.

Key Steps:

    Data Acquisition:
        Data was obtained from OSM and ALKIS through GeoFabrik and BBBike.
        Filtering and adjustment of data were performed using QGIS.

    Data Processing and Analysis:
        Map Algebra was used to adjust attributes according to the analysis criteria.
        Visual analysis and comparison of attributes between ALKIS and OSM were conducted.

    Filtering:
        Coordinates were adjusted using "Re-project Layer" in QGIS.
        Data was filtered to determine the percentage of overlap between ALKIS and OSM.

    Comparison:
        Visual comparison of building geometries between ALKIS and OSM.
        Assignment of colors indicating the level of match.

    Script for OSM to ALKIS Automation:
        Development of a Python script using GeoPandas to automate the analysis.
        This script needs further testing and adaptation as necessary.

Code Usage:

    The ALKIS_OSM.py script performs the comparison and generates visual results.
    The monitor_geojson.py script monitors the creation of new .geojson files and automatically executes the main script.

Usage Instructions:

    Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Configure environment variables as needed.
    Run python monitor_geojson.py to start monitoring.

Acknowledgments:

    The project structure was inspired by Florian Lohoff.

Important Note:
This project contains sensitive ALKIS data from the Bielefeld city government. Ensure to remove or replace sensitive data before publicly sharing.
